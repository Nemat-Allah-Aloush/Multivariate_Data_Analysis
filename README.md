# Multivariate Data Analysis
Implementing Tasks in Python Programming Language.
The tasks are assignments for Academical Course : "Methods and Models for Multivariate Data Analysis" in ITMO university.

# The selected dataset for the laboratory works is “House Appliances Energy Dataset”. 
It is an experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy
building.
The dataset contains 29 different features; all features are continuous except one. There are 19735
record in the dataset with no missing values. The information in the data are:
- Temperature and humidity inside different rooms in the house. (18 columns)
- Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility and temperature of dew point outside the house. (6 columns)
- Appliances: the energy used in the house. (1 column)
- Lights: energy use of light fixtures in the house. Which is the discreet column. (1 column)
- 2 random variables. (2 columns)
- Date and time of measuring the variables. (1 column).
The variables are in celsius, in watt, or in percentage. The data is measured each ten minutes for about 4.5 months.
